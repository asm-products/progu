1. Write a program that displays, "Java is great!", "ProgU is amazing!", "I like cake."

2. Write a program that displays "Welcome to Java." five times.

3. Write a program that displays.

   PPPP RRRR OOOO GGGG     U  U
   P  P R  R O  O G        U  U
   PPPP RRRR O  O G    === U  U
   P    RR   O  O GGGG     U  U
   P    R R  O  O G  G     U  U
   P    R  R OOOO GGGG     UUUU
   
4. Write a program that displays the table.
   
   a a^2 a^3
   1 1   1
   2 4   8
   3 9   27
   4 16  64
   
5. Write a program that computes and displays the answer to, (9.5 * 4.5 - 2.5 * 3)/(45.5 - 3.5)

6. Write a program that computes and displays the answer to, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9

7. PI can be estimated with the formula: 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...)
	Write a program that computes and displays the answer to 4 * (1.0 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11)
	
8. Write a program that displays the area and perimeter of a circle with a radius of 5.5.
	(perimeter = 2 * radius * PI), (area = radius * radius * PI)
	
9. Write a program that displays the area and perimeter of a rectangle with the width of 4.5 and height
	of 7.9. (area = width * height)
	
10. If a runner runs 14km in 45min and 30 seconds, what is his average miles per hour? Write a program that
	solves this problem. (1 mile = 1.6 kilometers)
	
11. The U.S. Population is estimated based on the following criteria:
	* One birth every 7 seconds.
	* One death every 13 seconds.
	* One new immigrant every 45 seconds.
	
	What will be the population for each of the next fiver years? Assume the current population is
	312,032,486 and one year is 365 days. (No leap years.) Use a program to solve this problem, make
	sure to get your answer in decimal form.
	
12. If a runner runs 24miles in 1hr, 40min and 35sec, what is his speed in kilometers.
	(1 mile = 1.6 kilometers) Write a program that solves this problem.
	
13. Cramer's rule is as follows:
	ax + by = e  x = (ed - bf)/(ad - bc)  y = (af - ec)/(ad - bc)
	cx + dy = f    

	Write a program that finds x and y for the following two equations:
	3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
	2.1x + .55y = 5.9
